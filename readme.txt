Love WordPress SEO by Yoast, but hate its dashboard clutter? Well, look no further!

== Description ==

[WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) is a fantastic plugin for optimising your site's search engine performance. The only problem is that it makes a mess of your WordPress dashboard by adding columns, meta boxes and custom fields. These additional items are great for SEO power-users, but for the average joe they just get in the way and make your dashboard difficult to use.

"WordPress SEO Tamer" fixes this problem by removing all of the admin columns, meta boxes and custom fields. There are no options to configure - just activate the plugin and enjoy a cleaner WordPress dashboard without losing any of the other useful functionality provided by WordPress SEO. The changes apply to all post types and taxonomies.

1. Download the plugin via WordPress.org
1. Upload the ZIP file through the 'Plugins > Add New > Upload' screen in your WordPress dashboard
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
